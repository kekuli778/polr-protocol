POLR Protocol

This repository contains the canonical specifications, governance artifacts,
reference implementations, and test vectors for the POLR Protocol.

Authoritative protocol semantics are defined exclusively by accepted RFCs.

Reference implementations in this repository currently use a TypeScript-first
tooling stack with Solidity and zero-knowledge circuits. These choices are
non-normative and may evolve independently of the POLR Protocol.
