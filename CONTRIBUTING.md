Contributing to POLR

Any contribution that affects protocol behavior MUST:
- Reference the relevant RFC(s)
- Declare the affected protocol layer(s)
- Include test vectors for any semantic change

Pull requests that modify accepted RFCs will be rejected.

Reference implementations currently use a TypeScript-based toolchain described
in IMPLEMENTATION.md. Contributions should respect the non-normative nature of
these choices.
